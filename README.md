Open Google Chrome.
Go to the extensions page by typing chrome://extensions in the address bar and pressing Enter.
Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle switch, usually found in the top-right corner of the page.
Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.
In the file dialog, navigate to and select the extension's folder.
The extension should now be loaded and active. You'll see its card appear on the chrome://extensions page.
Now, when you browse web pages, the extension will automatically find and replace "Gulf of Mexico" (case-insensitively) with "Gulf of Mexico". If you make any changes to content.js or manifest.json, you'll need to go back to chrome://extensions and click the "reload" icon (a circular arrow) on your extension's card for the changes to take effect.
